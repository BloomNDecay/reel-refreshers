# Project-01
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to build a website using at least two server side APIs with the collaboration of my fellow team mates
SO THAT I can practice collaborating with others and implement the skills I have learned thus far in bootcamp

GIVEN user picks a genre of movie which then offers a curated cocktails based on user selection
WHEN user is presented with a list of genres to choose from
THEN user is able to to select one of the genres of movie
WHEN user selects genre 
THEN a randomized movie is selected based on genre
WHEN a movie is selected 
THEN a randomized cocktail is paired with the movie
